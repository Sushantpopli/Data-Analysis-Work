# 🏡 Housing Price Analysis

This project analyzes housing price data to uncover trends, relationships, and key insights using Python data analysis and visualization techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore a housing dataset and perform:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization of important features  
- Insights into factors affecting housing prices  

This project is designed as a **data analysis case study** and can be a reference for anyone starting with **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `housing.csv`  
- Contains housing-related attributes such as location, area, price, number of bedrooms, etc.  
- Columns cleaned and prepared for analysis.  

*(Note: Dataset is included in this repository if not too large, otherwise replace with dataset link.)*

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas (data manipulation)
  - NumPy (numerical computing)
  - Matplotlib (visualization)
  - Seaborn (statistical plots)
  - Jupyter Notebook (analysis environment)

## 📈 Key Steps
1. Import and clean dataset (remove duplicates, handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns).  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
3. Visualize patterns using **Seaborn and Matplotlib** (heatmaps, scatterplots, histograms).  
4. Extract insights into which features influence housing prices the most.
